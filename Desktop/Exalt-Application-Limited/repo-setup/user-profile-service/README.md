## Environment Strategy

This repository follows the branch-based environment strategy:

- **Production**: \main\ branch
- **Staging**: \staging\ branch
- **Development**: \development\ branch

## Zero Regression Strategy

1. Comprehensive test coverage
2. Feature flag system for graduated rollouts
3. CI/CD pipeline integration
4. Automated validation

## Environment Configuration

Each environment has its own configuration file:

- \environments/development.config\
- \environments/staging.config\
- \environments/production.config\

## Development Workflow

1. Create feature branches from \development\
2. Submit PRs to \development\
3. After testing, promote to \staging\
4. After validation, promote to \main\ (production)
